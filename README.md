# LibrariaAI

This project enables natural language querying of a MySQL-based library management system using LangChain, Google's Gemini Pro, and a few-shot prompting strategy. It demonstrates how to turn user questions into accurate SQL queries using a large language model and embedding-based example retrieval.

# 🔍 Key Features
Query a live MySQL database with plain English

Powered by Google Gemini Pro and LangChain
